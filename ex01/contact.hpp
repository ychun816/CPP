/*
Understanding private: and public:

These are access specifiers in C++ that control who can access the members (variables & functions) of a class.

ðŸ“Œ private: (Only accessible inside the class)
- Members (variables/functions) under private: cannot be accessed from outside the class.
- Only the class's own functions (methods) can access them.
- This is useful for encapsulationâ€”it hides details from outside interference.

ðŸ“Œ public: (Accessible from outside the class)
- Members under public: can be accessed from anywhere.
- Typically used for functions that let users interact with private data.
