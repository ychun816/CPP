Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I scared off 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 now
Said "I don't like It" when I'm on my shit
Cause I'm just "so much better" than you
Pull up the fine print
Love and all vibing
'till they see girl like better somehow
Doing up my thing
Good for the writing
Who's gonna run when they hear my sound?
Who's gonna run when they hear my
Who's gonna run when they hear my
Don't want no guy
To run off and cry
Cause I played him some of my worst
Sounds like a lie
Happened in real time
Hope he don't feel no worse or no hurt
Said I'm on my
I do like this
No I didn't come to play
You could be on yours
But you keep on getting in my way
They say "way way too good to me"
So that they never stay
I've been told differences
But I think that it's jealousy
I think that's jealousy
I think that is jealousy
I think that's jealousy
I think that is jealousy
Telling me not your style
All ideas Lame, wack, it's twisted
Sit a little, ah ah wait for a while
And it's like Whole mindset it's shifted
See you really running up my style
Wrap it up nice, pass it on its gifted
I think it's vile
I think
I think it's vile
Cause they keep telling me
Enemies love you like friend to me
Hate me but they love my flow
All of the talking
Like why you so for it
Your back to corner
With nowhere to go
Some mistakes that I made on ways
If i share my yays
Will you take my woes
Love to the strays
From back in the day
Come and they played
In game I wrote
Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I'm on my
I'm on my
Said I'm on my
I do like this
No I didn't come to play
You could be on yours
But you keep on getting in my way
They say "way way too good to me"
So that they never stay
I've been told differences
But I think that it's jealousy
I think that's jealousy
I think that is jealousy
I think that's jealousy
I think that is jealousy
